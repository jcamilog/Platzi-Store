Project carried out from the angular course for platzi master

The project is an e-commerce connected to an API where administrative management can be enhanced, such as adding products, editing products, deleting products.
It also has registration through FireBase and uploading of images to the cloud

# Administrative module

To enter you have to redirect the Url as follows:
http: // localhost: 4200 / admin
Where it will ask you to log in, the registered account is
user:
admin@admin.com
password:
123456789

# Registration and login modules

To enter directly to the registration area we use the address:
http: // localhost: 4200 / auth / register
and for the login:
http: // localhost: 4200 / auth / login

It does not have redirection from the nav since it is only for administrative entry
